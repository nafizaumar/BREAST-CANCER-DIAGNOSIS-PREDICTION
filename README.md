# BREAST-CANCER-DIAGNOSIS-PREDICTION
This project applies machine learning classification techniques to predict whether a breast tumor is Malignant or Benign, based on diagnostic features. It also forecasts recurrence or non-recurrence of malignant cases after a specific period. The aim is to assist in early detection, enabling timely treatment and improving patient outcomes.
